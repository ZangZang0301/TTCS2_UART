That you were ROMEO, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, "STAY AWAY FROM JULIET!"
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, "Please don't go, " and I said
ROMEO, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the PRINCE and I'll be THE PRINCESS
It's a love story, baby, just say, "YES"
